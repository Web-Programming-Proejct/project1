          <p class="para"> Little Redâ€™s gluttony got the best of her after
            eating 3 bear-sized portions of porridge and falls into a deep
            slumber. To their shock, when the homeowners return to their
            cottage, they find a small unawakenable white woman. Mistaking her
            for Sleeping Beauty they call up Prince Phillip to collect her.
            Little Red was never seen again.
